#### 1. Introduction

##### Problem Statement
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder affecting communication, social interaction, and behavior.  
- Current diagnostic methods are not standardized, subjective, and time-consuming.  
- Delay in diagnosis impacts early intervention and support for children with ASD.  
- Need for an automated and accurate system to assist in early prediction of Autism.  

##### Objectives
- To preprocess data using cleaning, feature engineering, class balancing, and standardization.  
- To apply machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVC, XG Boost) for Autism prediction.  
- To evaluate models and select the one with the best accuracy and generalization.  

##### Application of your Project
- Early screening tool in hospitals and clinics.  
- Useful for schools/child development centers to identify children at risk.  
- Helpful in rural and resource-limited areas where access to specialists is low.  
- Decision-support system for doctors to reduce manual workload and improve accuracy.

#### 2. Literature Survey

##### Background
- Machine Learning is increasingly applied in healthcare for early prediction of diseases.  
- Autism detection research focuses on behavioral, demographic, and clinical data.  
- Combining multiple features improves prediction accuracy but raises challenges like data imbalance.  

##### Limitations of Existing Systems
- Small and limited datasets affecting generalization.  
- Imbalanced datasets leading to biased predictions.  
- Models not scalable or accessible for wider use.
